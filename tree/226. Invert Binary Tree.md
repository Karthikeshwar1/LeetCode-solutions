**Why postorder?**

Because, if we do
* inorder: then the node will be visited once again
* preorder: then the node will be visited two more times

Preorder traveral ensures that the node is visited for the last time, hence we won't swap nodes more than once.



**C++ solution:**

```
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        
        invertTree(root->left);
        invertTree(root->right);
        if (root->left != nullptr || root->right != nullptr) {
            swap(root->left, root->right);
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

**Note:** Look at the code
`if (root->left != nullptr || root->right != nullptr)`
Here, if we use AND operator instead of OR operator, then we are assuming that the tree is a perfect binary tree and hence any node in the tree either has zero or 2 children. But the question doesn't assume the tree to be a perfect binary tree, hence use OR operator, allowing for conditions where a node might have only 1 child.

Time complexity: **O(n)**
Space complexity: **O(n)** [Due to function [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack), which happens whenever we do recursion. Specifically, it's O(logn) for normal binary trees, where `logn` is the depth/height of the binary tree. But in case of skewed trees, the depth is `n` and the space complexity can be the worst which is O(n)]
