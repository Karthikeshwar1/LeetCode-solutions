**Why use set?**

Because it stores elements in an order, so that it becomes easy to compare with another set, if they contain the same elements.

**Why multiset?**

Because sets don't store duplicates. Anagrams may have duplicate characters.

C++ solution using multiset:

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        multiset<char> s1(s.begin(), s.end());
        multiset<char> s2(t.begin(), t.end());
        
        return s1 == s2;
    }
};
```

Time complexity: **O(n)** (to store the anagrams in sets)
Space complexity: **O(n)**
