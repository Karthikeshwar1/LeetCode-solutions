I know, it's not the optimal solution, but it provides a different perspective on solving the problem.

**Why stack?**
> Because it helps to make sure that the order of the characters in string **t** is present as required by string **s**. As you all know, this is because of [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))'s unique property of [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))

C++ solution:

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        stack<char> st_s;
        stack<char> st_t;
        
		// push all the chars in string 't'
        for (char c : t) {
            st_t.push(c);
        }
        
		// push all the chars in string 's'
        for (char c : s) {
            st_s.push(c);
        }        
        
		// pop element in both stacks, if the top element matches
		// otherwise pop only stack 'st_t'
        while (!st_s.empty() && !st_t.empty()) {
            if (st_t.top() == st_s.top()) {
                st_t.pop(), st_s.pop();
            } else {
                st_t.pop();
            }
        }
        
		// if stack 'st_s' is empty, it means that all of its
		// chars were found in stack 'st_t' in order
        return st_s.empty();
    }
};
```

Time complexity: **O(n)**
Space complexity: **O(n)**
